# _**Watson Assistant Lab 2**_: Integrating RPA with Watson Assistant
In this lab we're going to show how you can extend your chatbot by using RPA capabilities using _**IBM Cloud Functions**_.

In practical terms, we'll build another _**Watson Assistant**_ _intent_, that allows the user to submit a new address information. When we pick up this _intent_, we'll ask the user for the new address, feed the input text through the RPA and return a response based on the success of the address change. 

## Requirements
- IBM Cloud account 
- Previous lab

## Agenda
- Setup _**IBM Cloud Function**_
- Setup _**Watson Assistant**_ to use _**IBM Cloud Functions**_ 


## Setup _**IBM Cloud Function**_
**(1)** We need a mechanism by which we can call the RPA service, so we can passing our user's input text to the API. We'll do this by creating an _**IBM Cloud Function**_.

With _**IBM Cloud Functions**_ you can write lightweight code that executes application logic in a scalable way. You can then run this code on-demand via requests from applications like our _**Watson Assistant**_ chatbot, or automatically in response to events.

Some examples of how we might use an _**IBM Cloud Function**_ from within _**Watson Assistant**_ include:

- Validating information that you collect from the user.
- Doing calculations or string manipulations on user input that are too complex for supported _SpEL_ expression methods to handle.
- Interacting with an external web service to get information. For example, you might check on the expected arrival time for a flight from an air traffic service.
- Sending requests to an external application, such as a restaurant reservation site, to complete a simple transaction on the user's behalf.

**(2)** Go to _**IBM Cloud Functions**_ by selecting the `burger icon` in the top left-hand corner, then `Functions`.

![](./images/08-find-functions.jpg)

From there, first _**check the pulldown menu at the top right**_.

Make sure the selected location is the same region where you created your Watson Assistant service. 

Next, click `Start Creating`, then `Create Action`.

![](./images/09-functions-start-creating.jpg)

![](./images/10-create-action.jpg)

**(3)** Call your new action `RPAToken` then ensure you select a `Runtime` of **Node.js**, and hit `Create`.

![](./images/create-get-token.jpg)

You'll then be transported to a code editor. Delete all of the default lines of code within the editor, and replace them with these:

```Javascript
/**
  *
  * main() will be run when you invoke this action
  *
  * @param Cloud Functions actions accept a single parameter, which must be a JSON object.
  *
  * @return The output of this action, which must be a JSON object.
  * 
  * The port is unique to every environment 
  *
  */

const needle = require('needle');

async function main(params) {
    
var headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Host': 'api.eu-gb.apiconnect.appdomain.cloud'
};

var data = '{"refresh_groups": true,"requested_lifetime": 7200}';

var options = {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: headers,
    body: data
};

// Make sure you replace XXXX with your port number
var URL = 'https://api.eu-gb.apiconnect.appdomain.cloud/jkj-org-dev/sb/awib-workflow/login?port=XXXX';

  try {
    let response = await needle(URL,headers,options);
    var token = response.body.csrf_token;
    return {token};

  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
    return Promise.reject({
      statusCode: 500,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: { message: err.message },
    });
    console.log("error test");
  }
}
exports.main = main;
 
```

This code will call the RPA API and get the authentication token. 

**(4)** You only need to make a small change to this code.

- Replace `port=XXXX` with the value of your environment port.

Now hit `Save`.

![](./images/get-token-code-complete.jpg)

Select `Endpoints` from the sidebar, tick the `Enable as Web Action` box, then `Save`.

![](./images/17-enable-as-web-action.jpg)

Copy the Web Action URL and save it in a notepad, you will need it later. It should look like this:

https://us-south.functions.cloud.ibm.com/api/v1/web/sandra.calvo%40fi.ibm.com_dev/default/RPAToken.json

**(5)** Now let's create another action. Click on the Actions menu on the top left side of the screen:

![](./images/go-back-actions.png)

Then repeat the previous process. Create new action called: **RPACall** and paste the following code:

```Javascript
/**
  *
  * main() will be run when you invoke this action
  *
  * @param Cloud Functions actions accept a single parameter, which must be a JSON object.
  *
  * @return The output of this action, which must be a JSON object.
  *
  */

const needle = require('needle');

async function main(params) {
    
var headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'BPMCSRFToken': params.token,
    'Host': 'api.eu-gb.apiconnect.appdomain.cloud'
};


var payload = {
    input:[
      {
        name: 'data',
        data: {
          name: params.nimi,
          business_id: params.Ytunnus,
          street_address: params.osoite,
          postcode: params.postinumero,
          city: params.paikka,
        }
      },
    ]
  };

var options = {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: headers,
};

//Replace the XXXX with your port number
var URL = 'https://api.eu-gb.apiconnect.appdomain.cloud/jkj-org-dev/sb/awib-workflow/process?model=Handle%20data%20change&container=AWIBWOR&port=XXXXX';

  try {
   let response = await needle(URL,JSON.stringify(payload),options);
    var success = response.body;
    console.log(response.body);
    return {success};

  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
    return Promise.reject({
      statusCode: 500,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: { message: err.message },
    });
    console.log("error test");
  }
}
exports.main = main;

```

This code will use the authentication token from the previous action and call the RPA process with the data we enter in the Watson Assistant chatbot. 

**(6)** You only need to make a small change to this code.

- Replace `port=XXXX` with the value of your environment port.

Now hit `Save`.

Select `Endpoints` from the sidebar, tick the `Enable as Web Action` box, then `Save`.

![](./images/17-enable-as-web-action.jpg)

Copy the Web Action URL and save it in a notepad, you will need it later. It should look like this:

https://us-south.functions.cloud.ibm.com/api/v1/web/sandra.calvo%40fi.ibm.com_dev/default/RPACall.json


**(7)** We've now successfully created two _**IBM Cloud Function**_ that can accept text as input and talk to the RPA API. The final thing we need to do here is to make this function callable from within _**Watson Assistant**_ (or in fact, any other application).

Now let's go and use our functions in _**Watson Assistant**_.

## Setup _**Watson Assistant**_ to use _**IBM Cloud Functions**_
As you've already seen, you need to pass security credentials between services and applications in order to use them. In order to call _**IBM Cloud Functions**_ from within _**Watson Assistant**_ _dialogs_ we need to understand their credentials and encode them correctly.

**(1)** Get your _**IBM Cloud Function**_ **API Key** from the `API Key` option under `Getting Started`. There's a copy icon available to copy the key to the clipboard.

![](./images/get-functions-apikey.jpg)

**(2)** In your _**Watson Assistant**_ _skill_, you will see a node called `Conversation Start`. 
Under the 'set context' there is a variable called `$private` with the value below:
```Javascript
{"myCredentials":{"api_key":"<your-ibm-cloud-functions-api-key>"}}

```

Replace `<your-ibm-cloud-functions-api-key>` with the key you copied earlier in step **(1)**.

![](./images/add-credentials.jpg)

Now regardless of integration type our chatbot will always start correctly, and it will define the credentials required to call any of our _**IBM Cloud Functions**_.


**(3)** Even though the main conversation is in English we created this path in Finnish to prove Watson Assistant language capabilities. 

Find the node called _**Osoitten muutos**_ and as a child node you will see a node called _**Token**_. 

The **only** thing you will need to replace here is `<my-RPAToken-endpoint>`. If you didn't save the endpoint in you can get the name of your _**endpoint**_ by going back to your _**IBM Cloud Function**_ in IBM Cloud, clicking `Endpoints` from the sidebar (if you're not already on that screen), then copying everything in the **Web Action URL** _after_ _**.../web/**_.

It should look something like:
```Javascript
name.lastname_dev/default/RPAToken.json
```

![](./images/24-get-function-api-name.jpg)

![](./images/25-json-editor.jpg)

**(4)** Find the node called _**Kutsu RPA**_ and modify your enpoint. It should look like:

```Javascript
name.lastname_dev/default/RPACall.json
```
![](./images/24-get-function-api-name.jpg)

## Summary
You've reached the end of this lab! By completing it you've learned how to further enhance your chatbot by calling additional services using _**IBM Cloud Functions**_. 
Continue with lab 3 to get started with the Robotic Process Automation part. Once you have the RPA running you will be able to call it from your chatbot.
